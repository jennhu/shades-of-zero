  <h2>Hello, and welcome to our study!</h2>
      In this study, we will show you 30 simple statements.
      <p>
      We need your help deciding whether some things are <strong>probable</strong>, <strong>improbable</strong>, <strong>impossible</strong>,  or <strong>nonsense</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
      <p>
      <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      You are going to be given 30 statements. Please categorize them into one of the four categories above.

  <h2>Hello, and welcome to our study!</h2>
      In this study, we will show you 30 simple statements.
      <p>
      We need your help deciding whether some things are <strong>probable</strong>, <strong>improbable</strong>, <strong>impossible</strong>,  or <strong>nonsense</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
      <p>
      <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      You are going to be given 30 statements. Please categorize them into one of the four categories above.

  <h2>Hello, and welcome to our study!</h2>
      In this study, we will show you 30 simple statements.
      <p>
      We need your help deciding whether some things are <strong>probable</strong>, <strong>improbable</strong>, <strong>impossible</strong>,  or <strong>nonsense</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
      <p>
      <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      You are going to be given 30 statements. Please categorize them into one of the four categories above.

  <h2>Hello, and welcome to our study!</h2>
      In this study, we will show you 30 simple statements.
      <p>
      We need your help deciding whether some things are <strong>probable</strong>, <strong>improbable</strong>, <strong>impossible</strong>,  or <strong>nonsense</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
      <p>
      <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>

  <h2>Hello, and welcome to our study!</h2>
      In this study, we will show you 30 simple statements.
      <p>
      We need your help deciding whether some things are <strong>probable</strong>, <strong>improbable</strong>, <strong>impossible</strong>,  or <strong>nonsense</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
      <p>
      <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      You are going to be given 30 statements. Please categorize them into one of the four categories above.

    <p>Congratulations, you passed the comprehension check! Now we will move onto the experiment.</p>
    <p>Remember, your task is to categorize sentences into one of these four categories: 
    <p>
    <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
    <p>
    <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>
    <p>
  <p>For the trials, we will show you one sentence at a time. Please try to categorize the sentence as quickly as you can.

  <h2>Hello, and welcome to our study!</h2>
      In this study, we will show you 30 simple statements.
      <p>
      We need your help deciding whether some things are <strong>probable</strong>, <strong>improbable</strong>, <strong>impossible</strong>,  or <strong>nonsense</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
      <p>
      <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      You are going to be given 30 statements. Please categorize them into one of the four categories above.

  <h2>Hello, and welcome to our study!</h2>
      In this study, we will show you 30 simple statements.
      <p>
      We need your help deciding whether some things are <strong>probable</strong>, <strong>improbable</strong>, <strong>impossible</strong>,  or <strong>nonsense</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
      <p>
      <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      You are going to be given 30 statements. Please categorize them into one of the four categories above.

    <p>Remember, your task is to categorize sentences into one of these four categories: 
    <p>
    <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
    <p>
    <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>
    <p>
  <p>For the trials, we will show you one sentence at a time. Please try to categorize the sentence as quickly as you can.

    <p>Congratulations, you passed the comprehension check! Now we will move onto the experiment.</p>
    <p>Remember, your task is to categorize sentences into one of these four categories: 
    <p>
    <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
    <p>
    <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>
    <p>
  <p>For the trials, we will show you one sentence at a time. Please try to categorize the sentence as quickly as you can.

    <p>Congratulations, you passed the comprehension check! Now we will move onto the experiment.</p>
    <p>Remember, your task is to categorize sentences into one of these four categories: 
    <p>
    <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
    <p>
    <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>
    <p>
  <p>For the trials, we will show you one sentence at a time. Please try to categorize the sentence as quickly as you can.

  <h2>Hello, and welcome to our study!</h2>
      In this study, we will show you 30 simple statements.
      <p>
      We need your help deciding whether some things are <strong>probable</strong>, <strong>improbable</strong>, <strong>impossible</strong>,  or <strong>nonsense</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
      <p>
      <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      You are going to be given 30 statements. Please categorize them into one of the four categories above.

    <p>Congratulations, you passed the comprehension check! Now we will move onto the experiment.</p>
    <p>Remember, your task is to categorize sentences into one of these four categories: 
    <p>
    <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
    <p>
    <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>
    <p>
  <p>For the trials, we will show you one sentence at a time. Please try to categorize the sentence as quickly as you can.

  <h2>Hello, and welcome to our study!</h2>
      In this study, we will show you 30 simple statements.
      <p>
      We need your help deciding whether some things are <strong>probable</strong>, <strong>improbable</strong>, <strong>impossible</strong>,  or <strong>nonsense</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
      <p>
      <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>

      You are going to be given 30 statements. Please categorize them into one of the four categories above.

  <h2>Hello, and welcome to our study!</h2>
      In this study, we will show you 30 simple statements.
      <p>
      We need your help deciding whether some things are <strong>probable</strong>, <strong>improbable</strong>, <strong>impossible</strong>,  or <strong>nonsense</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
      <p>
      <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>

      You are going to be given 30 statements. Please categorize them into one of the four categories above.

  <h2>Hello, and welcome to our study!</h2>
      In this study, we will show you 30 simple statements.
      <p>
      We need your help deciding whether some things are <strong>probable</strong>, <strong>improbable</strong>, <strong>impossible</strong>,  or <strong>nonsense</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
      <p>
      <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      You are going to be given 30 statements. Please categorize them into one of the four categories above.

    <p>Congratulations, you passed the comprehension check! Now we will move onto the experiment.</p>
    <p>Remember, your task is to categorize sentences into one of these four categories: 
    <p>
    <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
    <p>
    <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>
    <p>
  <p>For the trials, we will show you one sentence at a time. Please try to categorize the sentence as quickly as you can.

    <p>Congratulations, you passed the comprehension check! Now we will move onto the experiment.</p>
    <p>Remember, your task is to categorize sentences into one of these four categories: 
    <p>
    <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
    <p>
    <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>
    <p>
  <p>For the trials, we will show you one sentence at a time. Please try to categorize the sentence as quickly as you can.

    <p>Congratulations, you passed the comprehension check! Now we will move onto the experiment.</p>
    <p>Remember, your task is to categorize sentences into one of these four categories: 
    <p>
    <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
    <p>
    <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>
    <p>
  <p>For the trials, we will show you one sentence at a time. Please try to categorize the sentence as quickly as you can.

    <p>Congratulations, you passed the comprehension check! Now we will move onto the experiment.</p>
    <p>Remember, your task is to categorize sentences into one of these four categories: 
    <p>
    <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
    <p>
    <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>
    <p>
  <p>For the trials, we will show you one sentence at a time. Please try to categorize the sentence as quickly as you can.

    <p>Remember, your task is to categorize sentences into one of these four categories: 
    <p>
    <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul>

  <h2>Hello, and welcome to our study!</h2>
      In this study, we will show you 30 simple statements.
      <p>
      We need your help deciding whether some things are <strong>probable</strong>, <strong>improbable</strong>, <strong>impossible</strong>,  or <strong>nonsense</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
      <p>
      <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      You are going to be given 30 statements. Please categorize them into one of the four categories above.

  <h2>Hello, and welcome to our study!</h2>
      In this study, we will show you 30 simple statements.
      <p>
      We need your help deciding whether some things are <strong>probable</strong>, <strong>improbable</strong>, <strong>impossible</strong>,  or <strong>nonsense</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
      <p>
      <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>

  <h2>Hello, and welcome to our study!</h2>
      In this study, we will show you 30 simple statements.
      <p>
      We need your help deciding whether some things are <strong>probable</strong>, <strong>improbable</strong>, <strong>impossible</strong>,  or <strong>nonsense</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
      <p>
      <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      You are going to be given 30 statements. Please categorize them into one of the four categories above.

    <p>Congratulations, you passed the comprehension check! Now we will move onto the experiment.</p>
    <p>Remember, your task is to categorize sentences into one of these four categories: 
    <p>
    <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
    <p>
    <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>
    <p>
  <p>For the trials, we will show you one sentence at a time. Please try to categorize the sentence as quickly as you can.

  <h2>Hello, and welcome to our study!</h2>
      In this study, we will show you 30 simple statements.
      <p>
      We need your help deciding whether some things are <strong>probable</strong>, <strong>improbable</strong>, <strong>impossible</strong>,  or <strong>nonsense</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
      <p>
      <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      You are going to be given 30 statements. Please categorize them into one of the four categories above.

    <p>Congratulations, you passed the comprehension check! Now we will move onto the experiment.</p>
    <p>Remember, your task is to categorize sentences into one of these four categories: 
    <p>
    <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
    <p>
    <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>
    <p>
  <p>For the trials, we will show you one sentence at a time. Please try to categorize the sentence as quickly as you can.

    <p>Congratulations, you passed the comprehension check! Now we will move onto the experiment.</p>
    <p>Remember, your task is to categorize sentences into one of these four categories: 
    <p>
    <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
    <p>
    <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>
    <p>
  <p>For the trials, we will show you one sentence at a time. Please try to categorize the sentence as quickly as you can.

    <p>Congratulations, you passed the comprehension check! Now we will move onto the experiment.</p>
    <p>Remember, your task is to categorize sentences into one of these four categories: 
    <p>
    <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
    <p>
    <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>
    <p>
  <p>For the trials, we will show you one sentence at a time. Please try to categorize the sentence as quickly as you can.

    <p>Congratulations, you passed the comprehension check! Now we will move onto the experiment.</p>
    <p>Remember, your task is to categorize sentences into one of these four categories: 
    <p>
    <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
    <p>
    <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>
    <p>
  <p>For the trials, we will show you one sentence at a time. Please try to categorize the sentence as quickly as you can.

  <h2>Hello, and welcome to our study!</h2>
      In this study, we will show you 30 simple statements.
      <p>
      We need your help deciding whether some things are <strong>probable</strong>, <strong>improbable</strong>, <strong>impossible</strong>,  or <strong>nonsense</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
      <p>
      <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      You are going to be given 30 statements. Please categorize them into one of the four categories above.

    <p>Congratulations, you passed the comprehension check! Now we will move onto the experiment.</p>
    <p>Remember, your task is to categorize sentences into one of these four categories: 
    <p>
    <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
    <p>
    <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>
    <p>
  <p>For the trials, we will show you one sentence at a time. Please try to categorize the sentence as quickly as you can.

    <p>Congratulations, you passed the comprehension check! Now we will move onto the experiment.</p>
    <p>Remember, your task is to categorize sentences into one of these four categories: 
    <p>
    <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
    <p>
    <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
    <p>
    <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>
    <p>
  <p>For the trials, we will show you one sentence at a time. Please try to categorize the sentence as quickly as you can.

  <h2>Hello, and welcome to our study!</h2>
      In this study, we will show you 30 simple statements.
      <p>
      We need your help deciding whether some things are <strong>probable</strong>, <strong>improbable</strong>, <strong>impossible</strong>,  or <strong>nonsense</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>

      <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
      <p>

  <h2>Hello, and welcome to our study!</h2>
      In this study, we will show you 30 simple statements.
      <p>
      We need your help deciding whether some things are <strong>probable</strong>, <strong>improbable</strong>, <strong>impossible</strong>,  or <strong>nonsense</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
      <p>
      <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>

      You are going to be given 30 statements. Please categorize them into one of the four categories above.

  <h2>Hello, and welcome to our study!</h2>
      In this study, we will show you 30 simple statements.
      <p>
      We need your help deciding whether some things are <strong>probable</strong>, <strong>improbable</strong>, <strong>impossible</strong>,  or <strong>nonsense</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Probable</strong> means it is something that is likely to happen. 
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my brush.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Improbable</strong> means it is something that is possible, but unlikely. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my hair.""</li></ul>
      <p>
      <strong>Impossible</strong> means it is something that cannot happen in our world given the laws of nature. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my mind.""</li></ul> 
      <p>
      <strong>Nonsense</strong> means it is something that does not make any sense due to some basic conceptual or structural error. 
      <p>
      <ul><li>For example, ""I painted the house with my number.""</li></ul>
